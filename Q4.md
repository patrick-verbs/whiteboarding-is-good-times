Question #4: Checking for Uniqueness
Write an algorithm that determines whether all the elements in a string are unique. You may not convert the string into an array or use array methods to solve this problem. The algorithm should return a boolean.

Example
Input: `"hello"`

Output: `false`

Input: `"copyright"`

Output: `true`

Solution
This seems like it should be fairly straightforward to anyone comfortable with loops. It's a simple matter of nesting -- an outer loop to run through each character in the input string, and an inner loop to run through each character *after* the current one to check for a match.
The huge benefit to using loops is efficiency: my function can end the search as soon as a match is found and break out without parsing any remaining characters in the string.

```
function allCharsUnique(inputString) {
  for (let i = 0; i < inputString.length; i++) {
    for (let j = i + 1; j < inputString.length; j++) {
      if (inputString[i] === inputString[j]) {
        return false;
      }
    }
  }

  return true;
}
```
